# Interactive_form
 FSJS project 3

 This is an interactive form of fictional Full Stack Conference. Includes inputs, selection menus, checkboxes.
 The project demonstrates my skills on working with online forms by making them interactive by JS programming:

 1) When the page loads the focus is automaticly redirected on the name input field;
 2) On the Job Role section the Other Job description input field is hidden and appears only after the selection;
 3) T-shirt info section is programmed to link Design selection menu options with only appropriete color options;
 4) Register for activities section proframmed for interactive cost sum up of all selected options;
 5) Payment info is made changable according to selected payment method;  
 6) Name, email, activity and credit card sections are checked by form validation using regular expressions;

10) Name and email input fields are programmed for realtime error messaging;
