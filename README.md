# Interactive_form
 FSJS project 3

 This is an interactive form of fictional Full Stack Conference. Includes inputs, selection menus, checkboxes.
 The project demonstrates my skills on working with online forms by making them interactive by JS programming:

 1) When the page loads the focus is automaticly set on the name input field;
 2) On the Job Role section the Other Job description input field is hidden and appears only after the selection;
 3) T-shirt info section is programmed to link Design selection menu options with only appropriete color options;
 4) Register for activities section proframmed for interactive cost sum up of all selected options;
 5) Payment info is made changable according to selected payment method;  
 6) Name, email, activity and credit card sections are checked by form validation using regular expressions;
 7) Focus/blur state event listener is added for activities checkboxes for accessability purpose;
 8) Form validation errors are displayed on sumbition and spotted at the certain place where user made mistake;
    when mistake is corrected - error sign is switched to correct status;
 9)
10) Name and email input fields are programmed for realtime error messaging;
11) Email input field error massage is customized for 2 options: if the field is empty - user is asked to type email, if the field is typed but incorrectly formated - user is asked to rewrite it correctly.
